# Bubble-sort.c


Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.


Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm. 
In computer graphics, it is popular for its capability to detect a tiny error (like a swap of just two elements) in almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear 
complexity (2n). 


Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which means that it requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order of elements in the input data set. While this is not necessarily a disadvantage, it can limit the efficiency of the algorithm in certain cases.
